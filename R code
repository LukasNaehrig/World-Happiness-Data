Scientific Question: How does the economy, family, and health status of certain countries influence the Happiness Score?
According to our linear model regressing the happiness score with economy/GDP per capita, family, and life expectancy, we found that the Family standing/status is the most influential factor in a country's happiness score. On the contrary, the economy/GDP per capita was the least influential factor in this score. Life expectancy was in the middle between economy and family factors. This implies that family status has the most relative weight in determining happiness scores.

# Q: Does happiness/factors depend on region more or more about individual countries? (Happiness ~ cultural value)
# define 3-4 regions, define variable for region, ANOVA (linear model has to be nested), differences without losing predictive power/ reduce RSE? 
# ANOVA more about -- inference, p-values, statistical significance

# analyze predictive power with random forest (apredictive performance)
